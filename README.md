# IoT Agent

The IoT Agent enrolls a device with the [IoT Identity](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/iot-identity) Service and 
receives credentials to access the MQTT broker. Via MQTT, it establishes communication with
an IoT management service, so the device can be remotely monitored and managed over a
secure connection.

The agent is intended to operate on a device running Ubuntu or Ubuntu Core with snapd enabled. 
The device management features are implemented using the snapd REST API.
